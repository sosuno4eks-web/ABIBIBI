║                    KDMapper Auditor - Quick Usage Guide                      ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
KDMapper Auditor verifies that your modified KDMapper leaves no detectable
traces on Windows 10 22H2. It's designed to test against ACE Anti-Cheat used
in Arena Breakout Infinite.

WHEN TO USE
-----------
✓ After modifying KDMapper (renaming strings, changing driver, etc.)
✓ Before each gaming session
✓ After Windows updates
✓ After anti-cheat updates
✓ When testing new stealth techniques

HOW TO USE
----------
1. Build the project in Visual Studio 2022 (Release x64)
2. Right-click KDMapperAuditor.exe → Run as Administrator
3. Review the test results
4. If all tests pass → Safe to proceed
5. If tests fail → Fix issues and re-test

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
[1] String Scan          - Scans kernel memory for mapper strings
[2] MmUnloadedDrivers    - Checks unloaded driver list for traces
[3] PiDDBCache           - Verifies driver database entries removed
[4] Event Log Scan       - Checks Windows Event Viewer for driver loads
[5] IOCTL Verification   - Tests if mapper IOCTLs still respond
[6] Handle Enumeration   - Checks for suspicious driver handles
[7] Signature Check      - Verifies test signing is disabled

INTERPRETING RESULTS
--------------------
[SECURE]     = Test passed, no traces detected (GREEN)
[VULNERABLE] = Test failed, traces found (RED)
[WARNING]    = Non-critical issue (YELLOW)

PASSING SCORE
-------------
7/7 tests must pass for safe deployment
Anything less = DO NOT USE until fixed

COMMON FAILURES
---------------
Test 1 Fails → Rename all strings in your mapper
Test 2 Fails → Clear MmUnloadedDrivers in driver
Test 3 Fails → Clear PiDDB cache in driver
Test 4 Fails → Clear event logs after driver load
Test 5 Fails → Change IOCTL codes and device names
Test 6 Fails → Close all handles before unload
Test 7 Fails → Disable test signing (bcdedit /set testsigning off)

WORKFLOW
--------
1. Modify KDMapper
   ↓
2. Build modified mapper
   ↓
3. Load driver via mapper
   ↓
4. Run KDMapper Auditor ← YOU ARE HERE
   ↓
5. All tests pass? → Proceed to game
   ↓
6. Tests fail? → Fix and repeat from step 1

REQUIREMENTS
------------
• Windows 10 22H2 (Build 19045)
• Administrator privileges
• Visual Studio 2022 (for building)
• x64 architecture

SAFETY TIPS
-----------
✓ Always run auditor BEFORE starting the game
✓ Run on clean system (no other cheats active)
✓ Test in safe environment first
✓ Don't skip tests - all must pass
✓ Re-test after any changes

WHAT IT CANNOT DETECT
----------------------
✗ Behavioral analysis by anti-cheat
✗ Kernel-mode anti-cheat scanning
✗ Hardware-based detection
✗ Network-based detection
✗ Advanced heuristics

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
Edit KDMapperAuditor.cpp to add:
• Your custom strings to scan for
• Your vulnerable driver name
• Your custom IOCTL codes
• Additional checks

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
1. Open KDMapperAuditor.vcxproj in Visual Studio 2022
2. Set configuration to Release x64
3. Build → Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
4. Output: x64/Release/KDMapperAuditor.exe

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Issue: "Failed to enable debug privilege"
Fix:   Run as Administrator

Issue: "Failed to query system module information"
Fix:   Run as Administrator, check Windows security

Issue: No output or crashes
Fix:   Verify Windows 10 22H2, x64 architecture

Issue: False positives
Fix:   Review each detection, verify if related to your mapper

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (ALL PASS)
--------------------------
=== TEST 1: String Scan in System Memory ===
[SECURE] String Scan

=== TEST 2: MmUnloadedDrivers Trace Check ===
[SECURE] MmUnloadedDrivers Check

=== TEST 3: PiDDBCacheTable Verification ===
[SECURE] PiDDBCache Check

=== TEST 4: System Event Log Scan ===
[SECURE] Event Log Scan

=== TEST 5: IOCTL Verification ===
[SECURE] IOCTL Verification

=== TEST 6: Handle Enumeration Check ===
[SECURE] Handle Enumeration

=== TEST 7: Driver Signature Verification ===
[SECURE] Driver Signature Check

=== AUDIT SUMMARY ===
Tests Passed: 7/7

[✓] ALL TESTS PASSED - Mapper appears SECURE
[✓] No obvious traces detected
[✓] Should be safe against ACE detection

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (FAILURE)
-------------------------
=== TEST 1: String Scan in System Memory ===
  [!] Module: iqvw64e.sys contains: intel
  [!] Vulnerable driver loaded: iqvw64e.sys
[VULNERABLE] String Scan

=== AUDIT SUMMARY ===
Tests Passed: 6/7

[✗] VULNERABILITIES DETECTED
[✗] Mapper may be detectable by ACE
[✗] Review failed tests and clean up traces

NEXT STEPS AFTER PASSING
-------------------------
1. ✓ All tests passed
2. Load your game cheat driver via mapper
3. Start Arena Breakout
4. Monitor for detection
5. If detected → re-run auditor to find new traces

SUPPORT
-------
For issues or questions:
• Review README.md for detailed information
• Check source code comments
• Test in safe environment first

DISCLAIMER
----------
This tool checks for KNOWN detection vectors. Anti-cheat systems evolve
constantly. Passing all tests does NOT guarantee 100% undetectability.
Always test in safe environment first. Use at your own risk.
