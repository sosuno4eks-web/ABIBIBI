╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PROJECT: KDMapper Auditor v1.0
TARGET: Arena Breakout Infinite (ACE Anti-Cheat)
PLATFORM: Windows 10 22H2 (Build 19045)
PURPOSE: Verify custom KDMapper stealth modifications

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT IT DOES
------------
KDMapper Auditor is a comprehensive stealth verification tool that checks for
traces left by kernel driver mappers. It performs 7 critical tests to ensure
your modified KDMapper is undetectable by ACE Anti-Cheat.

WHY YOU NEED IT
---------------
After modifying KDMapper (renaming strings, changing vulnerable driver, etc.),
you need to verify that NO traces remain that could be detected by anti-cheat.
This tool automates that verification process.

7 CRITICAL TESTS
----------------
[1] String Scan          → Scans kernel memory for mapper-related strings
[2] MmUnloadedDrivers    → Checks unloaded driver list for traces
[3] PiDDBCache           → Verifies driver database entries are removed
[4] Event Log Scan       → Checks Windows Event Viewer for driver loads
[5] IOCTL Verification   → Tests if mapper IOCTLs still respond
[6] Handle Enumeration   → Checks for suspicious driver handles
[7] Signature Check      → Verifies test signing is disabled

PASS/FAIL CRITERIA
------------------
✓ ALL 7 TESTS MUST PASS (7/7) for safe deployment
✗ ANY FAILURE = DO NOT USE until fixed

QUICK START
-----------
1. Build: Open KDMapperAuditor.vcxproj in Visual Studio 2022
2. Run: Execute as Administrator
3. Review: Check all 7 test results
4. Deploy: If 7/7 pass, proceed to use mapper

✓ Detailed trace identification
✓ ACE Anti-Cheat specific checks
✓ Windows 10 22H2 optimized
✓ Easy to customize for your mapper

✓ Registry service entries
✓ Driver files in System32\drivers
✓ Windows Event Viewer entries
✓ Active IOCTL handlers

WHAT IT CANNOT DETECT
----------------------
✗ Behavioral analysis by anti-cheat
✗ Kernel-mode anti-cheat scanning
✗ Hardware-based detection (TPM, etc.)

✗ Advanced heuristics
✗ Future detection methods

TYPICAL WORKFLOW
----------------
1. Modify KDMapper
   ├─ Rename all strings
   ├─ Change vulnerable driver
   ├─ Change device names
   └─ Change IOCTL codes
   
2. Build Modified Mapper
   └─ Compile in Release mode
   
3. Load Driver
   └─ Use modified mapper
   
4. Run KDMapper Auditor ← CRITICAL STEP
   ├─ Execute as Administrator
   ├─ Wait for all 7 tests
   └─ Review results
   
5. Evaluate Results
   ├─ 7/7 Pass → Proceed to step 6
   └─ Failures → Fix issues, return to step 1
   
6. Deploy
   ├─ Load game cheat driver
   ├─ Start Arena Breakout
   └─ Monitor for detection

COMMON FAILURE FIXES
--------------------
Test 1 Fails → Rename ALL strings in mapper source code
Test 2 Fails → Implement MmUnloadedDrivers clearing in driver
Test 3 Fails → Implement PiDDB cache clearing in driver
Test 4 Fails → Clear System event log after driver load
Test 5 Fails → Change IOCTL codes and device names
Test 6 Fails → Close all handles before driver unload
Test 7 Fails → Disable test signing (bcdedit /set testsigning off)

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
Edit KDMapperAuditor.cpp to customize:

• SUSPICIOUS_STRINGS[] array
  └─ Add your custom strings to scan for

• VULNERABLE_DRIVERS[] array
  └─ Add your vulnerable driver name

• IOCTL definitions
  └─ Add your custom IOCTL codes

• Device names
  └─ Add your custom device names

BUILD REQUIREMENTS
------------------
• Visual Studio 2022 (Community or higher)
• Windows 10 SDK (latest)
• C++20 support
• x64 platform
• Administrator privileges (for running)

RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
• Windows 10 22H2 (Build 19045)
• x64 architecture
• Administrator account
• Debug privilege (auto-enabled)

OUTPUT INTERPRETATION
---------------------
[SECURE]     = Test passed, no traces detected (GREEN)
[VULNERABLE] = Test failed, traces found (RED)
[WARNING]    = Non-critical issue (YELLOW)
[INFO]       = Informational message (WHITE)

EXAMPLE: ALL TESTS PASS
------------------------
=== AUDIT SUMMARY ===
Tests Passed: 7/7

[✓] ALL TESTS PASSED - Mapper appears SECURE
[✓] No obvious traces detected
[✓] Should be safe against ACE detection

→ SAFE TO PROCEED

EXAMPLE: TESTS FAIL
-------------------
=== AUDIT SUMMARY ===
Tests Passed: 5/7

[✗] VULNERABILITIES DETECTED
[✗] Mapper may be detectable by ACE
[✗] Review failed tests and clean up traces

→ DO NOT USE - FIX ISSUES FIRST

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
✓ Run auditor BEFORE starting game
✓ Run on clean system (no other cheats)
✓ Test in safe environment first
✓ Re-test after any modifications
✓ Re-test after Windows updates
✓ Re-test after anti-cheat updates

LIMITATIONS
-----------
• Cannot detect all possible traces
• Anti-cheat systems evolve constantly
• Passing tests ≠ 100% guarantee
• Always test in safe environment
• Use at your own risk

FINAL NOTES
-----------
This auditor is a CRITICAL tool in your stealth verification workflow. Do NOT
skip this step. Running the auditor before deployment can mean the difference
between safe operation and instant detection.

Remember: Passing all tests does NOT guarantee 100% undetectability, but it
significantly reduces the risk of detection by known methods.

Always test in a safe environment first. Never use on your main account until
thoroughly tested.
