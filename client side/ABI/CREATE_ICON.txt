  REALTEK ICON CREATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

To complete the identity spoof, you need a Realtek-style icon.

OPTION 1: Extract from Real Realtek Driver (Recommended)
  1. Find a legitimate Realtek audio driver on your system:
     C:\Windows\System32\drivers\RTKVHD64.sys
     C:\Program Files\Realtek\Audio\HDA\RtkAudioService64.exe
  
  2. Use Resource Hacker to extract the icon:
     - Open Resource Hacker
     - File → Open → Select Realtek file
     - Icon Group → Right-click → Save
     - Save as "realtek_icon.ico"
  
  3. Copy to both locations:
     - client side/ABI/realtek_icon.ico
     - Driver/realtek_icon.ico

OPTION 2: Download Realtek Icon
  1. Search for "Realtek icon" online
  2. Download a 256x256 or 128x128 icon
  3. Convert to .ico format using online converter
  4. Save as "realtek_icon.ico"
  5. Copy to both locations

OPTION 3: Create Simple Icon (Fallback)
  1. Create a simple audio-themed icon (speaker/headphone)
  2. Use orange/red color scheme (Realtek brand colors)
  3. Convert to .ico format
  4. Save as "realtek_icon.ico"

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
  If you don't have an icon yet, the build will still work.
  The .rc file will compile without the icon, but you'll get a warning.
  Add the icon later for complete authenticity.
