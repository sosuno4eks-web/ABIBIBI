DRIVER (MyDriver1.sys):
✅ Successfully built!
📁 Path: C:\Users\Lev\Desktop\Driver\x64\Release\MyDriver1.sys
📊 Size: 20,992 bytes (~20 KB)
🔧 Configuration: Release x64
⚠️ Warnings: MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ALIGNMENT macro redefinition (harmless)

CLIENT (ABI.exe):
❌ Build failed - needs fixes
📁 Expected path: C:\Users\Lev\Desktop\client side\ABI\x64\Release\ABI.exe
🐛 Issues:
   1. Inline assembly (__asm) not supported in x64
   2. uniform_int_distribution<uint8_t> not allowed
   3. Missing driver.cpp file

FIXES NEEDED:
1. Remove inline assembly from Mutation.hpp (x64 doesn't support it)
2. Change uint8_t to int in uniform_int_distribution
3. Remove or fix driver.cpp reference in project

NEXT STEPS:
1. I'll create a fixed version of Mutation.hpp for x64
2. Update the project file to remove driver.cpp
3. Rebuild the client

NOTE: The driver is ready to use! You can load it with KDMapper while I fix the client.
